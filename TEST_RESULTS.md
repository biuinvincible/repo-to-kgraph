# Test Results for Repository Knowledge Graph System

## Test Repository Created

We successfully created a comprehensive test repository that simulates a real e-commerce application with:

- **Models**: User, Product, and Order models with proper relationships
- **Services**: UserService, ProductService, and OrderService with business logic
- **API**: FastAPI endpoints for RESTful access
- **Utilities**: Database access, security functions, and payment processing
- **Frontend**: JavaScript utilities and HTML interface
- **Documentation**: README, architecture docs, and tests

## Parsing Results

The repository was successfully parsed by our kgraph system:

- ✅ **12 files** processed
- ✅ **392 entities** identified
- ✅ **284 relationships** established
- ✅ **Embedding generation** completed successfully
- ✅ **Database storage** (Neo4j and ChromaDB) completed

## Query Testing Results

Unfortunately, querying the system did not return expected results:

- ❌ "user authentication implementation" - 0 results
- ❌ "user registration" - 0 results
- ❌ "payment processing" - 0 results
- ❌ "user service" - 0 results

## Analysis

The parsing phase works correctly, indicating that:
1. File parsing and entity extraction is functional
2. Relationship detection is working
3. Database storage is operational
4. Embedding generation is successful

However, the query functionality appears to have issues:
1. Queries return 0 results even for terms that clearly exist in the codebase
2. This suggests a problem with either:
   - The query processing mechanism
   - The similarity search/retrieval system
   - The embedding matching algorithm

## Recommendations

1. **Debug the query processor**: Examine the query processing pipeline to understand why valid queries return no results
2. **Check embedding retrieval**: Verify that embeddings are being correctly stored and retrieved for similarity search
3. **Test the retrieval mechanism**: Ensure that the system can match query embeddings to stored entity embeddings
4. **Validate confidence thresholds**: Check if the confidence thresholds are set too high, filtering out valid matches

The system shows promise in parsing and analyzing code repositories but needs work on the query/retrieval functionality to be ready for coding agent integration.
